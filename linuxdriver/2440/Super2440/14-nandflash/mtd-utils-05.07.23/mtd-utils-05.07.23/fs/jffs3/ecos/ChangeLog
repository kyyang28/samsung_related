2004-03-31  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@infradead.org>

	* src/fs-ecos.c (jffs3_fo_write): Set ri.isize so that non-append
	writes don't truncate the file.
	
2004-03-03  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * src/fs-ecos.c: 
	Make JFFS3 honor O_TRUNC flag (again) when opening files with read
	Access.

2004-03-17  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>

	* src/fs-ecos.c: 
	With CYGOPT_FS_JFFS3_WRITE=1, file creation failed. The problem
	was introduced in fs-ecos.c 1.20
	
2004-03-11  Oyvind Harboe <oyvind.harboe@zylin.com>
	
	* src/fs-ecos.c:
	  Fixed umount memory leak. root->jffs3_i.dents where not freed.
	
2004-02-20  Vincent Catros  <Vincent.Catros@elios-informatique.fr>

	* src/fs-ecos.c :
	(jffs3_find) Policy to skip path separator is no longer
	"if '/' then skip" but "while '/' then skip" allowing
	multi '/' separators (i.e : /tmp////foo).
	(find_entry) Policy to detect end of path is no longer
	"if '\0' then end_of_path"
	but "while '/' skip it and then if '\0' then end_of_path"
	allowing path terminated with any number of '/'
	(i.e : chdir(/tmp///)).

2004-03-03  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

       * src/fs-ecos.c:
       Make JFFS3 honor O_TRUNC flag when opening files /w read access.

2004-02-17  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@infradead.org>

	* src/fs-ecos.c:
	Don't re-initialise the already-locked f->sem. It makes eCos unhappy. 

2004-01-27  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@infradead.org>

	* src/write.c: 
	Fix bug noted by Howard Gray; dirents belong to, and should dirty, 
	the _parent_inode, not the child (which may be zero in the case 
	of an unlink).

2004-01-09  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

       * src/fs-ecos.c: Fixed inode reference counting in jffs3_ops_link().

2004-01-05  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

	* cdl/jffs3.cdl: Re-added CYGPKG_FS_JFFS3_CFLAGS_REMOVE that had been
	removed by previous change.
	
2003-11-26  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@infradead.org>

	JFFS3 cleanup and import of newer code. Remove last vestiges of
	Linuxisms such as 'struct inode' from the core code, leaving eCos
	with no excuse, and renaming the eCos 'struct inode' to make that
	point. Fix i_count handling throughout. Clean up remaining Linuxisms
	such as 'struct qstr' to the point where jffs3port.h can be removed.
	Add skeleton for background garbage-collect thread. Fix compression
	so that it's actually called, and even with the right pointers. Turn
	on -Werror again. Zero tolerance is a good thing. Make the i_mode
	conversion functions non-inline to avoid warnings. Fix namespace
	pollution (of all but ^jffs3_* at least). Move physical flash I/O
	functions into separate file flashio.c for relatively easy
	substitution. Various other cruftectomy.

2003-11-25  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

	* src/fs-ecos.c: ARM gcc 3.2.3 is also broken. Complain with any
	ARM gcc 3.2 compiler.

2003-11-21  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: Do not require zlib package if no
	compression configured.

2003-11-20  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * cdl/jffs3.cdl:
        * src/malloc-ecos.c:
        * src/fs-ecos.c: Allocate jffs3_raw_node_ref structs
        from pool or malloc depending on a CDL configuration.

2003-11-20  David Woodhouse <dwmw2@infradead.org>

        * Rearrangement of the compression code into a cleaner API
	which can be disabled under control from CDL.
	
2003-10-14  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * src/os-ecos.h: Made definition of CONFIG_JFFS3_FS_DEBUG
        conditional, so it can be overwritten by a -D compiler
        option.
                                                                               
2003-09-23  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

2003-09-21  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>
            Andrew Lunn     <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        * src/fs-ecos.c: Do not decrement mount count for unsuccessful
        umount attempts.

2003-09-19  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * src/fs-ecos.c: Another inode number fix.

2003-09-18  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * src/fs-ecos.c: Inode number returned by stat() was bogus.

2003-07-27  Andrew Lunn  <andrew.lunn@ascom.ch>

        * src/os-ecos.h: Added new #defines require for the recent jffs3
        import.

2003-07-27  Michael Checky  <Michael_Checky@ThermoKing.com>
 
        * src/fs-ecos.c: Changed the return error code to be negative as
        expected by jffs3_flash_read() and jffs3_flash_write().
        
2003-04-23  Bob Koninckx  <bob.koninckx@mech.kuleuven.ac.be>

        * src/fs-ecos.c: mtab -> cyg_mtab. Ditto cyg_mtab_end. 

2003-03-25  Thomas Koeller  <thomas.koeller@baslerweb.com>

        * src/fs-ecos.c
        Fixed segmentation fault when unmounting file system.

2002-01-28  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/super-ecos.c: Removed.
        * src/jffs3.c: Merge jffs3_write_super() and jffs3_put_super() into
        the routines from which they were called, put jffs3_read_super()
        in as a static function with a view to doing same RSN.
        * src/jffs3port.h: Remove prototypes of functions that died.
        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: Remove super-ecos.c
        * src/dir-ecos.c src/write.c: Increase highest_version _before_

2002-01-27  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/read.c (jffs3_read_inode_range): Deal correctly with
        non-page-aligned read requests. We have to deal with the 
        case where we want to read from somewhere other than the
        beginning of a frag. 
        * src/jffs3.c (jffs3_fo_read): Use jffs3_read_inode_range
        instead of jffs3_readpage.

2002-01-25  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: We want CYGPKG_IO_FILEIO_INODE.
        * src/dir-ecos.c (jffs3_symlink): Remove. eCos doesn't support symlinks.
        (jffs3_mknod): Similar.
        (jffs3_mkdir): Don't call d_instantiate - its a nop.
        (jffs3_rename): Ditto.
        * src/file-ecos.c (jffs3_commit_write): Don't set blocks.
        * src/jffs3.c (jffs3_flash_writev): Rewrite to only write aligned
        quantities to flash.
        * src/jffs3port.h: Lots of decrufting.
        * src/os-ecos.h: Ditto (a bit).
        * src/readinode.c (jffs3_read_inode): Don't set blocks/blksize in inode.
        * src/write.c (jffs3_new_inode): Ditto when __ECOS.
        (jffs3_write_dnode): don't call writev with extra vectors
        unnecessarily.
        * src/super-ecos.c (jffs3_statfs): Remove - unused.

2002-01-25  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/super-ecos.c: Cruftectomy.
        * src/compr*.[ch] src/pushpull.h: Namespace cleanups merged from
        mainstream sources. Bit push functions made inline.
        * src/pushpull.c: Removed.
        * cdl/jffs3.c: Remove reference to pushpull.c
        * src/file-ecos.c: Cruftectomy. Lots of unused stuff here.
        * src/jffs3.c src/jffs3port.h: Remove some functions from jffs3.c
        which are no longer used, move some others to jffs3port.h as
        inline functions so they don't pollute the namespace.

2002-01-24  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * tests/fileio1.c: Check in listdir that the number of dirents is
        correct, taking into account existing files in case it's live.

        * src/dir-ecos.c (jffs3_readdir): move to....

        * src/jffs3.c (jffs3_fo_dirread): here. And fix the return code
        in the process so it now works.
        (filldir): Make inline and simpler.
        * src/jffs3port.h: remove filldir related stuff.

2002-01-24  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/dir-ecos.c: Cruftectomy. Remove most of the stuff that was
        commented out. Remove jffs3_do_{create,link,unlink} to write.c
        * src/write.c: Add jffs3_do_{create,link,unlink} as in mainline.
        * src/nodelist.h: Prototypes for the above.
        * src/jffs3port.h: Don't include <pkgconf/kernel.h>. 
        
2002-01-23  Jonathan Larmour  <jlarmour@redhat.com>

        * src/jffs3.c (jffs3_mount): Allow multiple FSs, and integration
        with flash block device.
        (jffs3_flash_read): Use flash block device.
        (jffs3_flash_erase): Ditto.
        (jffs3_flash_write): Ditto.
        (do_flash_init): Remove - now done by block device layer
        * src/list.h: Remove and reimplement from scratch to avoid GPL.
        * src/os-ecos.h: Keep flash block dev handle in superblock.
        eCos does support obsoleting as it isn't NAND only.
        * src/dir-ecos.c (jffs3_readdir): Return correct value on success.
        Merge in changes mutatis mutandis from between v1.49 and v1.51 of
        dir.c in main repository.
        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: CYGPKG_MEMALLOC more accurately CYGINT_ISO_MALLOC.
        Only jffs3.c needs to be in libextras.a
        Requires Flash block devices as an alternative for hardcoding
        the sector size, flash size and base address.
        * src/super-ecos.c (jffs3_read_super): Use flash block device for
        sector and flash sizes.
        * tests/fileio1.c: mount using block device (defined by CDL).
        No need to init here - done by flash block device layer.
        
2002-01-21  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/read.c: Obtain inode lock around reading symlink target.
        * src/dir-ecos.c: Fix the long-standing up() without down() in
        jffs3_readdir() when only the '.' and '..' entries are read, from
        v1.52 of master dir.c. Merge copyright date change from v1.50 - note
        that the portability cleanups from v1.51 aren't yet merged.
        * src/os-ecos.h: Add jffs3_can_mark_obsolete() and the macros
        for getting at generic inode fields from a struct jffs3_inode_info*
        * src/nodemgmt.c: Remove an #ifndef __ECOS and use 
        jffs3_can_mark_obsolete() instead.
        * src/jffs3port.h: up() is cyg_drv_mutex_unlock() not _release()
        * src/gc.c: Merge portability cleanups - get rid of a lot of
        references to 'struct inode'. Also include the attempt at NAND
        support in jffs3_garbage_collect_deletion_dirent().
        
2002-01-11  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/jffs3port.h: Switch semaphore emulation to cyg_drv_mutex_t,
        remove some kernel includes which seem gratuitous.
        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: Require CYGPKG_MEMALLOC
        * src/compr_zlib.c src/compr.c: Merge changes from mainline code
        to make mkfs.jffs3 compile again.
        
2002-01-10  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * src/jffs3.c: The 'mode' arg passed to jffs3_open() shouldn't
        have been called 'mode'. It's 'oflags'. You have to make up a 
        mode for the newly-created file yourself.
        * src/nodelist.h src/read.c: Fix jffs3_getlink() so it takes
        portable arguments, not a dentry. Move it to read.c and symlink.c
        becomes obsolete.
        * src/symlink-ecos.c: Removed.
        * cdl/jffs3.cdl: Remove symlink-ecos.c

2002-01-09  David Woodhouse  <dwmw2@cambridge.redhat.com>

        * Import updated JFFS3 sources into eCos tree.
