mtd-utils-05.07.23.tar.bz2

mtd-utils is the mtd jffs utilities separated from the rest
of the ktd sources, which are now part of the kernel sources.

For convenience, I've split the utilties and includes into
a separate tarball, with the mtd documentation.
All sources were taken from the original tarball:
mtd-snapshot-20050723.tar.bz2
